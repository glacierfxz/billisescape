Once you have a budget in place, the next step is to prioritize your spending. Identify the aspects of your honeymoon that are most important to you as a couple.

Once you've identified your priorities, allocate the largest portion of your budget to those areas.

## Accommodation Savings

Accommodation can often be one of the largest expenses on a honeymoon. However, there are several ways to save money on lodging without sacrificing comfort and style.
