Summer (June-August) can be hot, especially in Southern Spain, which may be less appealing for some. Winter (November-March) brings cooler temperatures and occasional rain, particularly in Portugal, and some attractions may have reduced hours. Spring and autumn strike the perfect balance, with comfortable temperatures and beautiful scenery. During spring, the landscapes burst into vibrant colors as flowers bloom, and in autumn, the foliage transforms into a stunning display of reds and golds. Consider your preferred activities and tolerance for heat or crowds when making your decision.
