### Plan in Advance for a Magical Disney Honeymoon

One of the most crucial tips for a successful Disney honeymoon is to plan well in advance. This applies to all aspects of your trip, from booking your flights and resort to making dining reservations and purchasing park tickets. The earlier you book, the better your chances of securing your preferred dates, resort, and experiences. Disney's popularity means that everything books up quickly, especially during peak seasons. Start planning at least six months to a year in advance to ensure you get the best options and availability. This proactive approach will help alleviate stress and allow you to fully enjoy the honeymoon experience.

#### Book Dining Reservations Early

Dining at Disney is a significant part of the experience, and making dining reservations is essential. Highly sought-after restaurants, especially those offering character dining or special experiences, can be booked up to 60 days in advance. Create a list of restaurants you'd like to try and be ready to make reservations the moment your booking window opens. Consider romantic restaurants with ambiance, such as those with views of fireworks or themed environments. Prioritize your must-do dining experiences and be flexible with your schedule if needed. This careful planning will ensure you and your partner enjoy the culinary delights Disney has to offer.

#### Utilize Disney's Genie+ Service

To maximize your time and minimize wait times, consider using Disney Genie+ service. This paid service allows you to book Lightning Lane entrances for select attractions, offering a smoother experience at the theme parks. Familiarize yourself with the service before your trip, and understand how to make selections each day. While it comes with an additional cost, the time saved can significantly enhance your honeymoon by allowing you to experience more attractions and spend more quality time together. Download the My Disney Experience app and learn how to navigate its features for booking rides and managing your itinerary.

### Choose the Right Disney Resort

The Disney resort you choose will set the tone for your honeymoon. Each resort offers a unique theme, amenities, and price point. Research the various resorts to find one that aligns with your preferences and budget. Consider factors like proximity to the parks, transportation options, dining availability, and the overall ambiance. Some resorts, such as the Polynesian Village Resort or the Grand Floridian Resort & Spa, offer a more luxurious and romantic experience, while others offer family-friendly activities that can be enjoyable for couples as well. Make a choice that suits your personalities and desired experience.

#### Consider a Deluxe Resort

Deluxe resorts often provide an enhanced experience that's perfect for a honeymoon. These resorts offer premium amenities, such as fine dining, luxurious pools, and exclusive transportation options like the monorail. They often feature elegant theming and quieter atmospheres, creating a more romantic setting. While more expensive, the added conveniences and special touches can significantly elevate your honeymoon. Consider the benefits of a deluxe resort, such as extended park hours, and weigh them against your budget to determine if it's the right choice for you.

#### Explore Romantic Activities

Beyond the theme parks, Disney offers a variety of romantic activities perfect for honeymooners. Consider a fireworks cruise, a couples massage at the spa, or a horse-drawn carriage ride. Enjoy a romantic dinner at a fine-dining restaurant or watch a beautiful sunset. Look for opportunities to experience unique, shared moments. Disney Springs offers shopping, dining, and entertainment options that can be fun for couples. Plan a special activity each day to enhance the romance and create lasting memories.

### Indulge in Spa Treatments

A spa treatment can be an incredibly relaxing and romantic way to spend an afternoon. Many Disney resorts offer luxurious spas where you can enjoy couples massages, facials, and other pampering treatments. This is a perfect way to unwind after a busy day at the parks and reconnect with each other. Book your spa treatments in advance to ensure availability and to incorporate them into your itinerary. It's a great way to de-stress and enjoy some quiet time together, away from the crowds.

#### Plan for Romantic Dining Experiences

Disney offers a wide array of dining options, and many restaurants are perfect for creating a romantic ambiance. Choose restaurants with beautiful settings, such as California Grill with its views of the fireworks or Be Our Guest Restaurant with its fairytale atmosphere. Book your reservations well in advance and request a table with a special view or in a secluded area. Consider adding a special touch like a bottle of champagne or a dessert to celebrate your honeymoon. Create a list of restaurants with themes and cuisine to ensure you have a memorable culinary experience.

### Pack Romantic and Comfortable Attire

When packing for your Disney honeymoon, don't forget to include romantic and comfortable attire. Pack outfits that make you feel special, such as nice dresses, elegant tops, and stylish accessories for evenings out. Comfortable shoes are essential for walking around the parks. Consider themed outfits, such as matching shirts or accessories, to add a fun element to your trip. The right clothing can enhance your experience and make you feel confident and ready to create beautiful memories. Don't forget to pack layers, as the weather can vary throughout the day and evening.

#### Consider PhotoPass and Memory Maker

To capture your honeymoon memories, consider purchasing Disney's PhotoPass and Memory Maker. PhotoPass photographers are stationed throughout the parks to take professional photos of you and your partner. With Memory Maker, you can download all the photos, including attraction photos, and add them to your collection. This service offers a great way to document your special moments and create lasting keepsakes. Plan ahead and decide if you want to add the Memory Maker to your purchase, and capture those magical moments you'll cherish forever.

### Don't Forget the Small Touches

Whether you're into adventurous rides or relaxing spa days, make sure to incorporate activities that both of you will enjoy.
