Get ready to discover the 'Pura Vida' lifestyle, the essence of Costa Rica, where life is celebrated to the fullest.

## Choosing the Best Time for Your Honeymoon

The timing of your Costa Rica honeymoon can greatly impact your experience. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is the most popular time to visit, offering sunny skies and minimal rainfall. This is ideal for beach relaxation, outdoor activities, and wildlife viewing. However, this is also peak season, so expect higher prices and more crowds. The green season, from May to November, offers lush landscapes, fewer tourists, and lower prices. While you can expect rain, it often comes in short bursts, leaving plenty of time for exploration and adventure. Shoulder seasons (April-May, November-December) provide a balance of pleasant weather and fewer crowds. Consider your preferences for weather, crowds, and budget when deciding on the best time for your trip.

## Costa Rica's Climate and Weather Conditions

Temperatures remain relatively constant year-round, averaging between 70u00b0F to 80u00b0F (21u00b0C to 27u00b0C) at lower elevations. Humidity is a factor, especially in rainforest areas. Pack accordingly with lightweight, breathable clothing, rain gear, and comfortable shoes. Be prepared for potential changes in weather, and embrace the natural beauty of Costa Rica, rain or shine. Always check weather forecasts closer to your travel dates to make final preparations and plan your itinerary accordingly.
